### 🏛️ Building Digital India, One Line of Code at a Time

**Software Developer @ National Informatics Centre (NIC), Government of India**  
*Where national-scale e-governance meets cutting-edge technology*

## 🎯 The Mission

I don't just write code—I architect solutions that serve millions. As a Software Developer at the National Informatics Centre under the Government of India, I'm part of the team building ICT infrastructure supporting e-governance services across all ministries, state governments, and district administrations. Every deployment impacts real citizens, real governance, real change.

Based in **Delhi, India** but operating at national scale, I define myself as a **product-minded engineer with a civic tech backbone**. I bridge the gap between modern web development practices and mission-critical government systems—a unique intersection that demands both innovation and uncompromising reliability.

While my expertise spans the **JavaScript ecosystem (React, Node.js, Next.js)** and recently **Laravel**, what truly drives me is the ability to deploy solutions that work for everyone—from metropolitan tech hubs to remote district offices with limited connectivity.

A proud **Navodayan** 🎓, I carry forward the values of community service, excellence, and inclusive education into every system I build.

> *"Code that serves the nation doesn't get to fail. It's not about perfection—it's about reliability at scale, accessibility for all, and security that protects 1.4 billion people."*

## 🏗️ Current Battlefield: Where Scale Meets Impact

My current work exists at the intersection of high-performance front-ends, resilient back-ends, and government-grade security:

* 🏛️ **Digital India Infrastructure:** Contributing to e-governance applications from eOffice automation to department-specific portals used by government officials across India
* 🔐 **Government-Grade Systems:** Building with Linux and Docker for deployment environments where uptime isn't optional and security clearance is mandatory
* ⚡ **Hybrid Architecture Specialist:** Combining **Next.js**'s SEO prowess with **Laravel**'s structured elegance to create full-stack applications that scale from village panchayats to ministry headquarters
* 📦 **Open Source Maintainer:** Active maintenance of `mantine-composite-filters` because the React ecosystem's growth benefits everyone—government and commercial sectors alike
* 🛠️ **Developer Productivity Zealot:** If I repeat a task three times, I automate it. My **Neovim** setup is a fortress of custom plugins and Lua scripts optimized for the rhythm of government project deadlines

## ⚙️ Arsenal: Tools Built for National Scale

My toolkit isn't just about languages—it's about building systems that don't break under the weight of a nation.

## 🚀 Deployed Missions: Code That Ships

The best measure of a developer is what they ship. Here's what I've launched:

### 🎨 [mantine-composite-filters](https://github.com/dvlprroshan/mantine-composite-filters)
> *Because filtering shouldn't require a PhD in state management.*

Built for the Mantine ecosystem, this library abstracts the brutal complexity of composite filtering logic. It handles multiple filter types, presets, history tracking, and advanced customization—all without drowning developers in boilerplate. When you need Excel-like filtering power without building it from scratch, this is your weapon.

**Stack:** TypeScript, React, Mantine  
**Impact:** Solving a core pain point for frontend developers building admin interfaces who need robust data management

---

### 📝 [dvlprnotes](https://github.com/dvlprroshan/dvlprnotes)
> *The developer's second brain—optimized for code, not essays.*

Standard note apps are built for writers. Developers need something different. `dvlprnotes` is a structured, lightning-fast web solution designed specifically for capturing code snippets, architectural decisions, and technical insights. Built because I was tired of losing critical implementation details between projects.

**Stack:** JavaScript, Web Technologies  
**Philosophy:** If you can't find your solution in under 3 seconds, your note-taking system has failed you

---

### 🌊 [TaskWave.nvim](https://github.com/dvlprroshan/TaskWave.nvim)
> *Task management for developers who refuse to leave their terminal.*

Context-switching kills productivity. I learned **Lua** specifically to build TaskWave—a native Neovim plugin that embeds task management directly into the editor workflow. No more Alt-Tabbing to some web app. No more breaking flow state. Tasks live where code lives.

**Stack:** Lua, Neovim API  
**Proof Point:** Sometimes the best tools are the ones you build yourself because nobody else understands your pain

---



### 💼 [40+ Client Projects](https://roshankumar.in/)
> *From freelance to full-time: building the web, one site at a time.*

I shipped over 40 different websites as a freelancer—everything from e-commerce platforms to corporate sites. Each project was a masterclass in understanding client needs, delivering on time, and maintaining systems long after deployment. Clients praised my technical soundness, dedication, and professional approach.

**Stack:** E-commerce, Corporate Websites, SEO Optimization, Custom Web Applications  
**Lesson Learned:** Real-world development is 20% coding and 80% communication, problem-solving, and post-deployment support

---

## ✍️ Knowledge Sharing: Teaching While Learning

I document what I learn—not just for others, but to solidify my own understanding. Writing forces clarity.

<div align="center">

[![Read on DEV.to](https://img.shields.io/badge/📚_Read_Articles-DEV.to-0A0A0A?style=for-the-badge&logo=dev.to&logoColor=white)](https://dev.to/dvlprroshan)

</div>

My articles focus on practical patterns, hard-won lessons, and "here's how I solved this problem so you don't have to bang your head against it for three days" type content.

---

## 🎓 The Navodaya Factor

Being a **Navodayan** isn't just an educational background—it's a mindset. The Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya system taught me:
- **Excellence is non-negotiable:** Half-measures don't cut it when you're competing with India's best
- **Community over individual glory:** Every line of code I write serves a larger mission
- **Resilience through adversity:** Building solutions with limited resources creates unmatched problem-solving skills

This ethos directly translates to my work in government tech, where constraints breed innovation and every deployment affects millions.
